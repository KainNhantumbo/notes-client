# Notes Client Application (React.JS + Typescript)

This repository contains a **markdown notes application** built with React.JS and Typescript, of course, with a flavor of other awesome community opensource packages.

Taking notes in markdown is made simple with this application. It provides the core features to create, organize, share and export your markdown notes in multiple file formats like JSON, Markdown, HTML and PDF.

Not limited, this application is capable of a robust markdown editing and preview, support for the dark and light modes, syntax highlighting, github flavored markdown and more. You can find the API source code [here](https://github.com/KainNhantumbo/notes-api).
