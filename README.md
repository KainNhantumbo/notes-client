# Choconotey Notes (React.JS + Typescript)

Welcome to **choconotey notes** app repository, built with React.JS and Typescript, and of course, with a flavour of other awesome community opensource packages.

Taking notes in markdown is made simple with this application. It provides the core features to create, organize, share and export your notes content in multiple formats like Markdown, HTML and plain text.

Not limited, the core editor is built on top of the headless [Tiptap Editor](https://tiptap.dev), empowering this application for robust note editing, with extensions, tools, syntax highlighting and more. You can find the API source code [here](https://github.com/KainNhantumbo/notes-api).
